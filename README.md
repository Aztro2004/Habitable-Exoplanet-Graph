## Affilation
Final project for the 2024-2 Distributed Computing (Cloud Computing) class, designed and developed at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de México(UNAM), at the Escuela Nacional de Estudios Superiores (ENES Morelia). This project is carried out by students of the Bachelor's Degree in Technologies for Information in the Sciences.
## Introduction
Exploration of the planets has advanced significantly with modern technology, including advanced telescopes and space missions, profoundly expanding our knowledge of the solar system and the universe. 

A habtiable zone is the distance from a star at which liquid water has the possibility of existing on orbiting planets’ surfaces. Habitable zones can also be known as Goldilocks’ zones, where conditions might be  neither too hot nor too cold for life. 


Thid is were the Habitable Graph Simulator Project comes in. This project emerges from building on the foundation laid by the information already given about exoplanets. This project seeks to leverage  simulation technology to create a comprehensive and interactive model of potentially habitable planets within these Goldilocks zones. By synthesizing data from sources, including the NASA exoplanet archive, this Habitable Exoplanet Graphing Project aims to provide a tool for the visualization and study of these distant worlds.

## Justification

This proyect aims to ease the visualization of planets in a habitable zone. By retrieving the numeric data given in the NASA Exoplanet Archive and processing it to display a 3D simulation graph we pretend to ease the visualization of the information that can sometimes be hardly interpreted by someone that doesn't have sufficient knowldedge to understand rough data of an exoplanet.
  
## Hypothesis
The problem issues several objectives that we want to put this way: Can this task be done on a fast and easy way for the user even if its not a computer science person? The way we see it, we state that is possible; having defined the variables that are attached to exoplanets by the NASA,  we can program a tool to read, filter and show the info that a CSV from the web page. 

## Objectives
* Implement a mechanism to retrieve planet data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive or a similar database.
* Ease the visualization of planets in a habitable zone.
* Graph planets if they are in a habitable zone.
* Implement a search algorithm that finds exo-planets in the habitable zone.
